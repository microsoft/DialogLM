{"src": "FARAI CHIDEYA , host : Now , moving on , Forest Whitaker as Moses , Tisha Campbell Martin as Mary Magdalene - well , that 's all in `` The Bible Experience . '' A New Testament edition was released in 2006 . This edition is billed as `` The Complete Bible . '' It does n't have one person reading the gospels . It features nearly 400 African-American artists , actors and ministers , plus sound effects . FARAI CHIDEYA , host : Just listen to Blair Underwood 's rendition of Jesus on the cross . Mr. BLAIR UNDERWOOD ( Actor ) : ( As Jesus ) My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? FARAI CHIDEYA , host : Now , we 've got two people affiliated with the project with us today . Kyle Bowser , he co-produced `` The Bible Experience '' and actress Wendy Raquel Robinson , one of the actors in `` The Bible Experience , '' and she also stars in the CW series , `` The Game . '' FARAI CHIDEYA , host : Hi folks , how are you doing ? Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON ( Actress ) : Great . Mr. KYLE BOWSER ( Co-producer , `` The Bible Experience : The Complete Bible '' ) : Great . How are you ? FARAI CHIDEYA , host : I 'm doing great . Now , Kyle , how did this project come about ? Mr. KYLE BOWSER ( Co-producer , `` The Bible Experience : The Complete Bible '' ) : Hmm . A couple of winters ago , while Christmas shopping , I purchased an audio bible and hoped that I would finally get through the Bible by listening to it in my car . And I had failed to read the Bible as I 'd promised . And after listening to a couple of disks , I was very disappointed . It just did n't really resonate with me . There was a lack of real production value . And the idea struck that perhaps we should try to do this ourselves and bring the Hollywood experience that we have to the process . And I think we have accomplished that goal . FARAI CHIDEYA , host : Were you ever afraid of crossing a line and saying , okay , we 're going to make this too Hollywood - the Bible is going too Hollywood ? And I 'm thinking of all the criticism of Mel Gibson 's movie , `` The Passion of the Christ . '' Mr. KYLE BOWSER ( Co-producer , `` The Bible Experience : The Complete Bible '' ) : No , that thought never really occurred to me . I think the gospel is applicable wherever you go including Hollywood . If anything , I was a little concerned about the idea of profiting from the Bible . But after consulting with some theologians and my grandmother , I got over that quickly . FARAI CHIDEYA , host : Now , Wendy - now , you were the voice of an angel in the book of Revelations . Let 's take a listen to that . FARAI CHIDEYA , host : Unidentified Man : A second angel followed and said , Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON ( Actress ) : ( As Angel ) Fallen . Fallen is Babylon the Great , which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries . Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON ( Actress ) : That ( unintelligible ) . FARAI CHIDEYA , host : What did you - yeah , absolutely . Absolutely . So - I mean , it 's not bad to be an angel . Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON ( Actress ) : No . FARAI CHIDEYA , host : Other than that , what made you want to do this ? Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON ( Actress ) : You know , it 's amazing . I feel like I got kind of bombarded the project . I knew Robi Reed who was also the casting director , and ( unintelligible ) who was actually working on it . And one day , I happened to be there and I saw a demo of what they were doing . And I said , hands down . How can I be a part of this ? Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON ( Actress ) : So I just pretty much put myself into it because I was just so drawn by the emotion , by - I mean , of course , you know , any time you 're doing something that 's related to the Gospel and to the Bible , you know - immediately I was drawn to that . But it was just so different from any project that I 've ever been attached to or had even , you know , been around . So I was just - I basically - I bombarded the project myself . FARAI CHIDEYA , host : Now , Kyle was just saying that he had a hard time listening to other audio bibles . Obviously , people are getting very much into the iPod… Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON ( Actress ) : Mm-hmm . FARAI CHIDEYA , host : …and podcasting , listening to this-that and the other in your car . Do you think that this opens up other people to the - I mean , we just did a series on religion not too long ago . Certainly , not every one is Christian . Not every black person is Christian , but there is… Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON ( Actress ) : Right . FARAI CHIDEYA , host : …plenty . Do you think this opens up new experiences for people who are plugging in or plugged into Christianity ?

And he 's been laying paralyzed for the last three months . [MASK] on [MASK] day in the hospital , he whispered in his wife [MASK] , asking for her to bring a copy of `` The Bible Experience '' to his room .

I think the only way to really measure the success of `` The Bible Experience '' [MASK] [MASK] to look at the [MASK] cards and the [MASK] testimony [MASK] we hear . [end] Mr. KYLE BOWSER ( Co-producer , `` The Bible Experience : The Complete Bible '' ) : And for me , as a Christian and many others , as Wendy said , it is the definitive word of God . But for others , it 's enjoyable because it is so dramatic . It is so emotionally powerful . You know , it 's historically accurate whether or not you apply the faith analysis to the word . So much of what 's written in the Bible has been proven to be historically accurate and we capture all of that so wonderfully . FARAI CHIDEYA , host : Wendy , what 's it like for you to be a part of this ensemble ? It 's one of the largest ensemble cast of black actors , I guess you could say . Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON ( Actress ) : It 's bigger than `` Roots . '' FARAI CHIDEYA , host : It is . Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON ( Actress ) : No . Oh , it is . I feel like it 's a part of history . I 'm sorry ; I did n't mean to cut you off . Go ahead . FARAI CHIDEYA , host : No , that 's - it 's true . Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON ( Actress ) : But I 'm honored , you know ? I mean , Blair Underwood , Forest Whitaker , you know , Angela Bassett . So , so many of the celebrities that I admire and look up to were a part of this . But that 's not why I was drawn to it , but it just takes it to a whole another level for me on so many different levels . Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON ( Actress ) : And to see these other artists , you know , praising God through their work , you know . It 's an anointed piece , you know , because you ca n't half-step with God . You know what I mean ? You have to really drink it , so when they did the interpretations in the studio and if you even get a chance to see the video portion of it , it 's amazing . I mean , it just brings you to tears emotionally . And just , you know , really reliving those moments , you can actually see these characters within the Bible come to life . FARAI CHIDEYA , host : Kyle , very quickly - I mean , super quick . Any future plans ? It 's - you kind of gone to both testaments , what have you got left ? Mr. KYLE BOWSER ( Co-producer , `` The Bible Experience : The Complete Bible '' ) : Well , we - meaning me and my partners - are all thinking about different ways that we can continue to share this wonderful experience in whatever medium is available - visually , through audio product , through all of the distribution technologies that are available . So please , stay tuned for that . FARAI CHIDEYA , host : All right . Well , Kyle and Wendy , thanks so much .

{"src": "RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : You have heard it again and again - this is an extraordinary election , unlike any other in recent memory . OK , so now imagine it 's your first election . We talked to a few young voters making their choices for the very first time in a general election . ASHANTI MARTINEZ : So my name 's Ashanti Martinez ( ph ) . I 'm 20 years old . I 'm from Prince George 's County , Md. , and I 'm voting for Hillary Clinton . LAUREN SMITH : Hi , I 'm Lauren Smith . I 'm 20 years old and I 'm voting for Trump . GENESIS LARIN : My name is Genesis Larin . I 'm from Houston , Texas . And I 'd say I 'm a conflicted voter but leaning towards Hillary Clinton . NICK TOMCHIK : My name is Nicholas Tomchik ( ph ) . I 'm from Winslow , Maine . I 'm 20 years old , and I 'm voting for Gary Johnson . RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : All right , so I want to learn more about how each of you came to your decision . So I 'm going to start with you , Lauren . You 're voting for Donald Trump . Did you support him in the Republican primary ? LAUREN SMITH : No , I actually supported Ted Cruz . And , you know , I have to say , there 's no question that this election cycle has been unbelievable . So I 'm voting for Trump because not only am I a Republican but he has a pro-life agenda . He 's for a limited government , and that 's what I support . Am I happy with him ? No , absolutely not . RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : Nick , you 've decided to support the Libertarian candidate , Gary Johnson . How come ? Why not Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton ? Why go with a third-party option ? NICK TOMCHIK : All my life , I 've gone against the status quo . I 'm a Libertarian myself . I definitely believe in what Gary Johnson has to offer , his policies - minimizing the role of government , pro-choice . You know , we 've got to cut the wasteful spending . We 've got to offer an alternative . And especially with this election being so , you know , as Lauren said , you know , pretty much crazy , we 've got to have another choice . And he brings that to America . And I really like that . RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : Genesis , you said you 're leaning reluctantly towards Hillary Clinton . But I understand that 's a big deal because you 're a registered Republican . GENESIS LARIN : I actually did not register with , like , a specific party affiliation . But yes , I am , I guess , leaning towards Hillary Clinton just because I 'm very disappointed in the candidates that I have to choose from . But I just ca n't support what Donald Trump has said , even though I did vote Republican for the primaries . However , I did vote for Marco Rubio . I feel like this election , at least for me , has come down to voting against someone instead of a vote for someone that actually aligns with a lot of , like , my views for certain issues . RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : And you have n't found that in either of the major party candidates ? GENESIS LARIN : It was mentioned before that Hillary Clinton , her experience as far as policies - and I do take into account her experience . And I guess I feel comfortable because she has been around . RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : What do you not like about her ? What gives you pause about her ? GENESIS LARIN : Part of it is her scandals . But it 's also she has , you know , kind of switched sides on some of the policies . So if anything , I was kind of confused on , like , exactly where she stands because it just comes off as she 's saying certain sides just to get a vote . RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : Ashanti , what do you think when you hear that ? I mean , you 're an ardent Hillary Clinton supporter , but she 's had kind of a tough time making inroads with people your age . What are the top issues for you ? ASHANTI MARTINEZ : One of them would be definitely college affordability , making sure that no matter where you are on the income spectrum in this country that you can go to college debt-free or that you can leave college debt-free . The next issue for me is health care , making sure that folks are able to have quality health care in this country . And then I guess the next issue for me that really comes home is criminal justice reform . Too many people of black and brown skin color , that look like me , go to jail , oftentimes , for sentences and things that they should n't have . RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : I want to ask you , Lauren - you heard Genesis say that she identifies as a Republican . She voted for Marco Rubio in the primary , but she 's considering voting for Hillary Clinton . What do you say to her ? LAUREN SMITH : I think as a Republican , I do n't understand how you could support Hillary Clinton . And I understand many of what Trump has said is , quite frankly , deplorable . And I completely get that . However , if you 're a Republican , if you believe in limited government , if you 're pro-life , vote for Donald Trump . And again , that 's the issues that I fully support and that I want to see happen in America . I want Roe v. Wade to be overturned . So Genesis , what I would say to you is , what issues are holding you back ? And why ca n't you vote for Donald Trump , if I can ask you that ... RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : Sure . LAUREN SMITH : ... Just head-on ? RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : Genesis , you want to answer ? GENESIS LARIN : Yeah . So I 'm actually pro-choice . I do ... LAUREN SMITH : OK . GENESIS LARIN : ... Believe that climate change is something that we need to address . That being said , I 've never particularly , I guess , been completely on board with bigger government . And that 's something that I think is what makes me more conservative , even though I guess I 'm more left-leaning . RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : You 're that coveted independent , Genesis , who everyone wants . RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : You 're that coveted middle-of-the-road voter . GENESIS LARIN : ( Laughter ) Yeah . And I feel - the way I approached the selection was n't blue or red or green , even . It was I wanted to find a candidate that I think was most representative of my view and whose competency in doing this , at being president , I would feel comfortable voting for . RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : Nick , let me ask you this - are you feeling enthusiastic about your choice ? Like , are you - how do you feel about supporting Gary Johnson ? NICK TOMCHIK : Yeah . I honestly am very enthusiastic about supporting him . That 's the thing that I think makes me different and also maybe the Libertarians or the independents that are , you know , supporting Gary Johnson . They 're actually voting for someone because they really like his policies . RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : And you do n't buy the argument that a vote for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein , on the other side - the Green Party , is a de facto vote for the other party , be it right or left ? NICK TOMCHIK : Not at all . I definitely think that that plays into the fear-mongering because from a lot of people I hear , they want to vote for Gary but they 're - you know , they tell me that argument . And essentially , if all the people who , you know , actually voted third party - said that they 're not going to vote for the third party because of that voted third party , then , you know , Gary Johnson has a huge chance of winning . [start] [MASK] : Lauren , your candidate , Donald Trump , has had a [MASK] kind of support from women [MASK] that [MASK] in good standing when [MASK] rolls around . Why do you think that is , especially when you talk to your peers , other young women ? I [MASK] [MASK] of the reluctance has to do with the kind of rhetoric we [MASK] him , those recent comments on the `` Access [MASK] in conversations ? LAUREN SMITH : You know , a lot of my [MASK] the women , do support Donald Trump . [MASK] sexual assault . I mean [MASK] . But we have to [MASK] long time ago . I mean , 2005 happened almost 11 years ago . So as far as [MASK] 's comment on women go - does [MASK] [MASK] ways , but I 'm choosing to look at the bigger picture . And I 'm choosing to look at America as a whole instead of trying to , you know , just go and tear Trump [MASK] what he said in the past [MASK] have spoken to , especially the the Women for Trump here in Virginia , of course they support him [MASK] If I can chime in , Rachel . Go for it , Ashanti . [end] ASHANTI MARTINEZ : For me - right ? - I 've talked to a lot of women . I 'm around women often . And these Trump allegations about him sexually assaulting women and bragging about it is deplorable . And it 's something that is definitely on people 's minds , especially around my age group . But this is n't the first instance , right ? We look at the comments that he had with former Miss America and former Miss Universe contestants . We look at the comments that he had about contributors on different networks . We look at the comments that he 's had of people on his own show , on `` The Apprentice , '' and how he 's treated women throughout his career , whether it be in real estate or whether it be on television . So to me , to say that these things do n't matter is wrong . This man has so many different things that do n't speak to our country as being inclusive and as progressive as we should be . And I think that 's why he 's not qualified . LAUREN SMITH : Well , I certainly understand that position . But I also have to say I do n't want Hillary Clinton as president . RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : This is your first time voting in a presidential election . So how you feeling ? I mean , what are the conversations that you 're having at home or with your friends ? Are people animated to get out and vote ? Is there a sense of apathy ? I 'm going to start with Lauren . What are people talking about in your circles ? LAUREN SMITH : There 's one side , the 50 percent - they 're very apathetic . They do n't want to get out and vote . You know , I 've lost friends because of the way I 'm voting . And , in some ways , I understand that . RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : You 've lost friends , really ? LAUREN SMITH : I have , yeah . But I would say that as a 20-year-old , as my first election , I ca n't believe these are the two candidates I have to choose from . I think - like , I do n't know about you all , but this is just unbelievable . RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : Anyone else want to weigh in on this ? What are the conversations ... NICK TOMCHIK : I ... RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : Nick , go ahead . NICK TOMCHIK : Yeah , I agree 100 percent . And I ca n't wait till it 's over . It 's been very crazy . I 've had some ( laughter ) - I 've had some tough conversations with , you know , friends and family because I 've got some family that 's , you know , voting Trump because they do n't like , you know , the Clinton , you know , scandals and , you know , a lot of her immigration stances , and then also my other friends and family who are voting Clinton because they do n't want Trump elected . So I 'm kind of in the middle here , you know , preaching the alternative . And it 's really tough . And from what I 've seen , people are , you know , in my circle , at least , excited to get out and vote . RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : Ashanti , are you excited ? I mean , it 's the first time you get to go to your polling station and cast a vote for president . ASHANTI MARTINEZ : Yeah , no , I 'm extremely excited . I mean , I 've been with her since she announced . And it 's one of those things where I 'm looking forward to her presidency , right ? And I 'm looking forward to January and what her next four years is going to look like in the White House . RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : I will leave it there . Ashanti Martinez , Genesis Larin , Lauren Smith and Nick Tomchik - they are voting in the presidential election for the first time . RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : Hey , you guys , thanks so much for talking with us . ASHANTI MARTINEZ : Thanks for having us . LAUREN SMITH : Thank you . NICK TOMCHIK : Yeah , absolutely .", "tgt": "RACHEL MARTIN , HOST : Lauren , your candidate , Donald Trump , has had a hard time getting the kind of support from women voters that he needs to put him in good standing when November 8 rolls around . Why do you think that is , especially when you talk to your peers , other young women ? I mean , how much of it - of the reluctance has to do with the kind of rhetoric we 've heard from him , those recent comments on the `` Access Hollywood '' tape ? Is that coming up in conversations ? LAUREN SMITH : You know , a lot of my peers , especially the women , do support Donald Trump . I do n't condone sexual assault . I mean , that 's utterly ridiculous . But we have to remember that was a long time ago . I mean , 2005 happened almost 11 years ago . So as far as Donald Trump 's comment on women go - does it bother me ? It does in some ways , but I 'm choosing to look at the bigger picture . And I 'm choosing to look at America as a whole instead of trying to , you know , just go and tear Trump to shreds over what he said in the past . So the women that I have spoken to , especially the the Women for Trump here in Virginia , of course they support him . ASHANTI MARTINEZ : If I can chime in , Rachel .

All they need is for people to move into them that can give them the love , attention and exponentially increasing property values their presence alone can bring . Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR ( Actor , Playwright ) : These watchful neighbors then patrol the old hood with their cell phones handy . If they see something that just is n't right , they call up the codes department , anonymously of course , and cry foul . So a couple of weeks ago , my mom 's hot water heater gave up the ghost and flooded the basement as a memorial . Yours truly drew the task of pulling 40 years of accumulated memories out of the basement to get to the flooding and save the day . Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR ( Actor , Playwright ) : Well , what do you know ? One of the ever-vigilant friendly neighborhood preservationist saw the pile by the basement door and reported my mother 's home as the site of a public dump . Welcome to America . Luckily , I 'd already ordered a dumpster unbeknownst to the good neighbors , so I sped up its delivery , charged the iPod , put on my favorite work jeans and started attacking memory mountain one little bit at a time .

Happy thoughts was sailing as I stepped into the mini mountain with my right foot . That 's when it happened . I had n't looked where I was stepping . If I had , I would have remembered I was directly over a hole in the ground my dad put a piece of wood over . And that was a good temporary fix , but I should mention that my dad passed away six years ago . Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR ( Actor , Playwright ) : Well , mix the way the five feet of junk , seven or eight years of rot , a fresh rain and a primary weight of a 6 ' 2 , 190-pound brother man on a size 13 boot , and what do you have - every bit of that mix headed two directions at blinding speed , forward and down . Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR ( Actor , Playwright ) : Instinct may be reached to both sides . And with a mix of luck and skill , I was able to catch myself just as I felt cold water rising up almost to my knee . There was no bottom . Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR ( Actor , Playwright ) : I said , whoa , out loud , then I had another thought . Wait a minute , is this a well or a sewer ? Oh , crap - an unintentional pun . I pulled myself up as one of the tenants was singing some Italian aria in my ears . Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR ( Actor , Playwright ) : My foot and leg were covered with something wet and black . I immediately ran and grabbed the garden hose , sprayed off my boot and pants ' leg , and thank god , my mom was n't helping me out because it could have been her . Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR ( Actor , Playwright ) : As I stripped and prepped the washer for my clothes , I thought to myself that if I would have fallen in , all I could have done was scream for one of my neighbors to come and rescue me . I wonder if they would have come . And if they did , would they have said , hmm , promise you 'll repaint in earth tones , preserve the subway tile in your bathroom and restore the original glass doorknobs in your hallway , and we 'll pull you right out of there , neighbor .
